[h1]Better Unite Burgundies[/h1]
Mod that changes improves the 'Unify the Burgundies'. The idea is to make the decision something you want to do before conquering
the Burgundian Kingdom, rather than something you do afterwards.

[h2]Key Changes[/h2]
* Decision now only requires full control over the duchies of Burgundy and Upper Burgundy
* Can now be used if already independent
* Can now be used if the Kingdom of Burgundy has already formed (will grant a pressed claim instead)
* Gain a unique CB upon using the decision that allows a de jure war for the Kingdom of Burgundy
* Gain event troops upon using the decision
* No longer forces you to go Occitan culture
* An event to diverge culture free of cost will happen sometime after using the decision (DLC dependant)

[h2]Game Rules[/h2]
* Combine Duchies: Determines what happens to the Burgundy and Upper Burgundy duchies when using the decision. Default behaviour is to merge them together.
* French Culture Enclave: Determines what happens to the French culture enclave that results from diverging culture. Default behaviour is to remove it by converting those counties to Occitan.
